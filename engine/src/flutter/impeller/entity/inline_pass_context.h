/// @brief  The load action the color attachment of pass number `pass_count`
///         over an entity pass target must use.
///
///         The first pass clears, because the target it is about to paint has
///         no contents anyone has vouched for. Targets handed out by
///         `RenderTargetCache` are recycled within and across frames and still
///         hold the previous tenant's pixels; their declared `kDontCare` is a
///         statement that no one chose a load action, not a statement that the
///         pixels are disposable. Inheriting it paints a save layer over
///         another layer's leftovers.
///
///         `honor_declared_load_action` is the narrow exception: the caller
///         owns this target and its declared action is a real decision. The
///         only such caller is the root pass over an embedder-supplied render
///         target, where an embedder doing partial repaint declares `kLoad` to
///         keep the pixels it preserved outside the damage region.
///
///         Later passes are continuations of a target this context has already
///         painted, so they load it -- except that a fresh MSAA attachment has
///         nothing to load and must be cleared before it is resolved.
