/// @brief      Context-scoped pool of `SwapchainTransientsVK`, keyed by
///             `(width, height, format, sample-count enabled)`.
///
///             Embedder backing-store flows that disable Flutter's render
///             target cache (e.g. when the host compositor owns the
///             presentable buffer ring) need the MSAA + depth/stencil
///             attachments to outlive a single `EmbedderRenderTarget` so
///             that they're not re-allocated on every frame. The
///             `SwapchainTransientsVK` instances internally cache those
///             textures, but they only persist while *something* keeps a
///             strong reference. This pool is that strong reference, owned
///             by `ContextVK` so its lifetime is bound to the graphics
///             context.
///
///             The pool is bounded by both an entry count and a byte budget:
///
///             - Entry cap protects against unbounded growth when many
///               distinct view sizes flicker through the cache (e.g.,
///               window resize storms).
///             - Byte budget protects GPU memory on desktop drivers that
///               cannot use lazily-allocated / memoryless attachments.
///               Memoryless allocations contribute zero to the budget,
///               since they consume no VRAM.
///
///             Entries are evicted in LRU order on insert until both
///             constraints are satisfied. The most-recently-acquired entry
///             is never evicted in the same call that produced it.
///
class TransientsPoolVK {
 public:
  /// Default cap on cached entries. An entry is leased for as long as some
  /// render target still references its attachments, so the working set is
  /// one entry per *concurrently live* render target, not one per distinct

  /// views at once and briefly holds all of their targets, so this is sized
